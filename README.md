# EE224-Resources
Welcome to EE224!  
Digital Systems taught by my favourite prof. - Virendra Singh :)  
Here, you will find some resources like lecture notes and a few slides.  
A big thank you to Neel and Himanshi for helping me be up-to-date throughout the course.  
Happy Learning!!!  

Notes' chronological order:

Himanshi's SAT notes complement Page 8 of reMarkable Notes Part 1.
